The classic 15 puzzle game made with Pixi.js and Typescript.

If you want other size, just use `new Game(N)` where N is a number which will be used to create the columns and rows, by default is 4.

## How to use
The folder dist has anything you need to play the game. But if you want to compile it just use `npm install` and `npm run dev` or `npm run build` to create the bundle.
